# Pirelay-6-Channel

PiRelay 6 channel is a relay shield that can control up to 6 appliances/devices with photo-coupling isolation on a load of 250V AC/7 A, 30V DC/10 A, and a trigger voltage of 3.3 V. It helps the user to enhance the intelligence of the devices. It comprises an “Optocoupler” that allows the circuit to transmit an electrical signal between two isolated circuits through light energy. Optocoupler helps the user to prevent the high voltages in one part of the circuit from affecting the other part of the circuit which provides safety to the system.
